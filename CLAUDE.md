# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Claude Code testing project ("Claude Code 測試專案") that appears to be a minimal repository for experimenting with Claude Code functionality.

## Repository Structure

This is a very simple repository containing only:
- `README.md` - Basic project description in Chinese
- `LICENSE` - Project license file

## Development Notes

This repository currently has no build system, package management, or development tools configured. It appears to be in the initial stages and may be used for testing Claude Code capabilities rather than active development.

Since there are no package.json, build scripts, or development dependencies, there are no specific commands to run for development, testing, or building at this time.
